* Introduction

This repository reproduces a bug of cache not being properly preserved
when used with cargo with multiple targets.

* Current behaviour

* Expected behaviour

- No recompilation.

* Workaround

There are several options available currently as an workaround for the
bug:

- Have separate target directories. You can use the option
  ~--target-dir~ to specify a different directory and then cache it.
- Create different github job for compiling using a specific
  architecture.
